# A-machine-learning-model-for-psychrophilic-proteins
#This ia a machine learning (ML) model for discrimination of psychrophilic enzymes. Support vector machines, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and na√Øve Bayes, and three descriptors i.e., amino acid composition (AAC), dipeptide combinations (DPC), and AAC+DPC were developed.
# The protein sequnces are available on the file.
